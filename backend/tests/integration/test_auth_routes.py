"""Integration tests for the session endpoints (FR-048, FR-079).

These are the routes contracted by `contracts/rest-api.md` under "Sessions": sign in, sign
out, and read the current session. They are integration rather than unit tests because a
single request crosses four modules — the users router, `app/dependencies.py`, the limiter in
`app/common/limits.py`, and the error middleware — and Constitution IV requires integration
tests for anything crossing a module boundary.

They drive the **real application** from `create_app()` rather than a hand-built app with the
router attached, because half of what can go wrong here is wiring: a router that is never
registered, or registered under a path the contract does not name, passes every unit test.

Most of the assertions below are about what a failure must *not* reveal. That is deliberate —
the success path of a sign-in endpoint is the easy half.

Redis is the in-memory fake from `tests/conftest.py`; no test contacts a real service.
