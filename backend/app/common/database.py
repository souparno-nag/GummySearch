"""Async database engine, session factory, and the shared declarative base.

This module owns the single SQLAlchemy `AsyncEngine` for the process. Every module
obtains sessions from here rather than constructing its own engine, so connection
pooling is shared and the process holds one pool rather than one per module.

`Base` is the declarative base every module's ORM models inherit from. A single
shared `MetaData` is what lets Alembic autogenerate see the whole schema at once;
it does not weaken the module boundary in Constitution II, which is about which
module may *query* which tables, not about which metadata object they register on.
