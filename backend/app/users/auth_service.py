"""Credential verification and session lifetime.

This is a single-user product (R11): the credential lives in configuration, there is no
self-service registration, and no query is scoped by tenant. Sign-in exists to protect one
person's data, not to separate accounts.

Everything here is built to the standard FR-079 sets — sound *as though the application
were publicly reachable* — because this release binds to loopback only by deployment
choice, and that choice must not be load-bearing. The measures that live in application
code are cheap now and are a migration later, so they are built now. The ones that live in
the deployment (transport security, abuse protection, monitoring) are deliberately absent
per FR-081.

Three properties are worth stating outright:

- **The stored credential is a scrypt hash**, not a password. `hashlib.scrypt` is a
  memory-hard key derivation function in the standard library, so this needs no dependency
  outside the constitution's committed stack.
- **Only a hash of each session token is stored.** A leaked Redis dump or backup therefore
  yields no usable session. The token itself is 32 random bytes, so SHA-256 is the right
  digest here — a slow KDF exists to protect low-entropy secrets, and this is not one.
- **Expiry is checked here, not merely delegated to Redis.** The TTL stops expired
  sessions accumulating; this module decides whether a session is valid.

Sessions live in Redis because it provides expiry and invalidation natively, which are the
two properties FR-079 requires. The constitution's Technology and Data Constraints section
names session entries as ephemeral operational state, exempt from the rule that no durable
data may exist only in Redis: that rule protects the collected corpus, which cannot be
re-fetched, whereas losing every session costs exactly one sign-in. The reasoning behind
the exemption is recorded in `docs/tasks/T020.md`.
