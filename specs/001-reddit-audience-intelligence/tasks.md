# Tasks: Reddit Audience Intelligence

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reddit-audience-intelligence/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Test tasks are included and are **not optional here**. Constitution IV requires
service-layer logic to be written test-first, forbids any test contacting Reddit or a model provider,
and sets an 80% service-layer coverage floor.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each can be implemented, tested, and delivered
independently.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependency on incomplete work)
- **[Story]**: Which user story the task belongs to (US1–US8)
- Every task names an exact file path
- Task IDs are stable and unique but not contiguous in document order. Tasks added after the first
  draft take the next free number rather than renumbering everything below them; execute in document
  order, not numeric order.

## Path Conventions

Web application per plan.md: `backend/app/`, `backend/workers/`, `backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/`,
`evals/` at the repository root.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and tooling

- [X] T001 Create the backend, workers, tests, frontend, and evals directory tree per plan.md

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — user story work can begin.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Build an audience and read its feed (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: A researcher groups communities into a named audience and reads one deduplicated timeline
across all of them, sorted and readable in-app.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Topics, themes, and trends (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Interpret an audience into topics and themes with descriptions, patterns, sentiment, and a
direction of travel over time.

**Independent Test**: Open analysis for an audience with a few hundred posts, drill into a theme, view
its patterns and trend, and confirm a fresh audience reports insufficient material instead of
inventing results.

### Evaluation harness first (Constitution IX)

### Comment collection for User Story 3 (FR-027, FR-027a, FR-027b)

> Analysis reads discussion, not just headlines — pain points concentrate in replies. Collection is
> placed here rather than in US1 because nothing before this story consumes comments, and unlike
> community snapshots, comments can be backfilled for posts still held.

- [ ] T166 [P] [US3] Write failing tests for relative engagement threshold selection across differently sized communities in backend/tests/unit/test_comment_threshold.py
- [ ] T167 [US3] Implement the community-relative engagement threshold in backend/app/reddit/comment_threshold.py

**Goal**: Plain-language questions answered from the audience's own material, with citations and an
honest refusal when the material does not support an answer.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 — Keyword alerts (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Standing rules evaluated against newly collected material, surfaced in-app.

**Independent Test**: Create a rule, run a collection cycle containing a match, and confirm it appears
with the rule and matched terms named — and that editing the rule leaves the match intact.

### Intent matching for User Story 5 (FR-082–FR-085)

> Additive to keyword matching, never a replacement. Keyword rules must keep working when the
> retrieval capability is absent or failing, so US5 still ships standalone if US4 has not been built.

- [ ] T157 [P] [US5] Label an intent-paraphrase reference set with positive paraphrases and unrelated controls in evals/datasets/alert_intents.jsonl

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 — Community discovery (Priority: P6)

**Goal**: Find communities worth tracking by search, ranking, tags, and accumulated history.

---

## Phase 9: User Story 7 — Saved posts and lead tracking (Priority: P7)

**Goal**: Bookmark posts with private notes and a status, filterable by state.

**Independent Test**: Bookmark from feed, search, and an alert match; set a status; filter by it;
confirm a bookmark of deleted material still shows captured text.

### Tests for User Story 7

- [ ] T135 [P] [US7] Contract tests for bookmark CRUD and status filtering in backend/tests/integration/test_bookmarks_api.py
- [ ] T136 [P] [US7] Unit test asserting captured content survives source deletion and is destroyed with the bookmark in backend/tests/unit/test_bookmark_capture.py

### Implementation for User Story 7

**Goal**: Make spend, latency, reuse, quota, freshness, and measured accuracy visible.

**Independent Test**: Run an analysis and an Ask, then confirm the usage view reflects spend, reuse,
and last-refreshed time — and that exhausting a ceiling fails clearly.

**Hard dependencies**

- US2, US3, US5, US6, US7 all require US1's ingestion to have collected material.
- US5's **keyword** matching has no AI dependency and can ship immediately after US1. Its **intent**
  matching (T157–T164) needs the embedding infrastructure from US4 (T105–T108). The two modes are
  deliberately separable: build US5 early for keyword alerts, and switch intent matching on once US4
  lands. This preserves US1 → US2 → US5 as a complete, AI-free, genuinely useful product.
- US4 requires US3's adapter and prompt infrastructure, plus its own chunk and retrieval work.
- US8 depends only on Foundational telemetry and can be built at any point after it.
- **Cross-story file dependency**: T171 (US3) modifies `backend/app/feed/search_service.py`, which
  T075 (US2) creates. This is intended — FR-020 makes search analysis conditional, so US2 ships the
  search path and US3 adds analysis to it once the interpretation layer exists. T171 must not run
  before T075.
- US6's history views require Foundational's snapshot task to have been running for weeks — build the
  UI whenever, but expect it to display nothing meaningful until history accrues.

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Foundational**: T012, T013, T015 (distinct common modules); T024, T025, T026 (distinct reddit
modules); T029 and T033, T034 (distinct model files); T045, T046 (distinct frontend files).

**US1**: T048–T052 all touch different test files and can be written together. T053 and T059 are
independent. T064, T065 are independent of backend work.

**US3**: T079, T080 are pure labeling and parallelize with each other and with T082–T085. T091, T092,
T093 touch separate service files.

**US4**: T100–T104 parallelize fully. T105 and T111 are separate model files.

**Polish**: T149, T150, T151, T153, T154, T155 are mutually independent.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP is Phase 1 through Phase 3** — Setup, Foundational, and US1. That yields a working multi-
community reader with deduplication, deletion handling, snapshot collection, and nightly backups. It
is genuinely demonstrable on its own and is the correct place to stop and evaluate.

**Then increment by story.** Each subsequent phase leaves the system shippable. US2 and US5 are the
cheapest next wins; US3 and US4 are the most differentiating and the most expensive.

**Two things run ahead of their story on purpose.** The snapshot task (T038–T040) sits in Foundational
because its output is a function of elapsed time — every day it is not running is permanently lost.
The evaluation datasets (T079, T080, T100) come before the AI services they measure, because
Constitution IX's regression gate is meaningless if the first prompt ships unmeasured.

**Order within a story**: tests → models → migration → services → routes → workers → frontend.
